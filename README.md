# TOOTR

A Cross-Platform <u>T</u>racker for <u>O</u>carina <u>o</u>f <u>T</u>ime <u>R</u>andomizer

### NOTE
<b>THIS TRACKER IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!</b> These are the platforms this tracker is planned to support:

<li>❌ Windows</li>
<li>❌ MacOS</li>
<li>❌ Linux</li>
<li>❌ iOS</li>
<li>❌ Android</li>

It is not currently available on mobile due to copyright issues from using the OoT 3D assets, and it is currently unavailable on desktop because I need to upgrade my development environment. It will be available to download hopefully in the near future.

<b>Still to do:</b>
<li>❌ Ability to delete file</li>
<li>❌ Ability to rename file</li>
<li>❌ Map Tracker</li>
<li>❌ Randomizer Settings</li>

## How to use:

When you first load the tracker you'll immediately be greeted by a file selection screen:

<img src="/screenshots/EmptyFileSelect.png?raw=true" width="256px" alt="Empty File Select"/>

Just click on the `+` in the top-right to create a new file:

<img src="/screenshots/NewFile.png?raw=true" width="256px" alt="New File" />

Once you've created a new file, and given it a name, you'll be taken into the main tracker:

<img src="/screenshots/NewTracker.png?raw=true" alt="New Tracker" width="256px" />

From here, just tap once on any item to toggle it on and/or increment its counter. If you make a mistake, it's no sweat! Simply double-tap on the item to toggle it off and/or decrement its counter.

<img src="/screenshots/UpperTracker.png?raw=true" width="256px" alt="Upper Tracker" />

This tracker also supports showing which temple has which medallion. To change the medallion that a temple has, long-press on the medallion icon:

<img src="/screenshots/MedallionSelector.png?raw=true" width="256px" alt="Medallion Selector" />

If you want to keep it the same, simply tap outside the box. Otherwise, select a medallion, and it will be shown as that temple's reward.

Each file will also automatically save any changes made, so you can always come back later!
